# WaveletFilter_PCA_ERPs
Combine wavelet filter and PCA and use them on ERPs 
Here, the Wavelet filter and Principal component analysis (PCA) have been done with simulated ERP data (20 subjects and two stimulus types)
The components before and after back-projected are also shown here

The wavelet filter is constructed following the guidance in the book 'Advanced Signal Processing on ERPs', Chapter 2, by Cong Fengyu 
Cong Fengyu wrote the PCA rotation codes.

Before running this script 'm_waveletFilter_PCA.m', the EEGLAB is necessary, and the 'topoplot' function was called from it
